I don't believe this should be considered DP, because even when you use naive recursion, the function is only evaluated once for each distinct argument. So, no caching or tabulation of previously-solved subproblems is necessary. Dynamic programming, properly speaking, is when there are overlapping subproblems, and we need to cache previously-solved subproblems in order to avoid evaluating them over and over again.
